= xmlvalidate
A tool to validate XML against XSD.

== Usage
Simply run xmlvalidate, passing in the two filenames to check:

  xmlvalidate schema.xsd document.xml 

If the filenames differ only in the extension .xml/.xsd, you may pass
just the basename:

  xmlvalidate document

== TODO
* Needs specs
* Needs documentation (Look into YARD!)
* Needs to be refactored into a libfile with methods easily usable
from in-code, like XML::validate()
